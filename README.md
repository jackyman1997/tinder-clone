# 1. step react app
(prep: install node.js, react.js, npm)
```
npx create-react-app {name of the app, as well as the directory name}
```

check 1: if you see `happy hacking` at the end of the process, you are good to start. 

check 2: `npm start`, if you can see a page pops up showing an spinning atom like svg, you are good to start. 
## vulnerabilities
Sometimes, there is some vulnerabilities afterwards, I guess it is about the packages updates or other issues. Trying to get a fix for this. 
### try 1
```
npm audit
npm audit fix
```
I choose to ignore this one for a moment as the main idea of this is not to fix vulnerabilities (although they are extremely important), read more [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/auditing-package-dependencies-for-security-vulnerabilities). 

# 2. Firebase
This is only to host the front end, steps are:  
- google `firebase`, setup an account if you don't have one 
- go to console
- add project (on free trial, only a limitted amount of projects can exist at a time)
- give it a name, then next
- turn off `Google Analytics`,then create project

# 3. Basic
First, according to the ivdeo, I deleted `App.test.js`, `logo.svg`, `setupTest.js` in `src`.  

checkout BEM class naming convention

CSS quick: 
```
<tag, * for all> {
  <key>: <value>; /* comments */
}
```

This seems like to be a very common template for js to build a DOM
```
import React from "react"; 

function Func() {
  return (
    <div className="">
    </div>
  );
}

export default Func
```

5. Tinder cards
Mainly from: 
```
